# Language Identification Challenge

This repository hosts data and the jupyter notebook used in a language identification hackathon challenged held on kaggle.

## About the Hackathon Challenge:
South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society.

The country is multilingual with 11 official languages, each of which is guaranteed equal status. Most South Africans are multilingual and able to speak at least two or more of the official languages.

For a detailed explanation of the hackathon and the solution refer to the language_identification.ipynb file on this repository.
